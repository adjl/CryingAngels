# Crying Angels
Project for JSOxford's Summer of Hacks #2: Game Dev Day

## Concept
The idea is to have the ~~Weeping~~ Crying Angels pursue you in a maze; they stop when you look at them.

This repo focuses on the implementation of the latter mechanic.

## Usage
On the desktop, click and drag to look around. On mobile, look around with your device as you would with AR/VR gear. Bonus points if you have Cardboard!

Subject, of course, to your browser and/or device being able to support VR features.

## Demo

## Remarks
- Pretend that the Lizzies and their fat cats are angelic...
- ... and that their spinning are them chasing and trying to kill you.
- To be fair, we did have moving angel statues and a maze...
- ... We just didn't get to put them together.
- It's not my idea :) Credit goes to [@edent](https://github.com/edent)
- Is actually called 'Crying Statues', but I mistyped. Oops.
- 'Twas fun making this.
